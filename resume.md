# Work Experience

### CTO - Klira (formerly Zensum) (2017-Present)

Klira is Sweden's third largest broker for consumer loans. During my
tenure we grew the team from zero to fifteen tech team members.  I worked
on replacing an existing legacy system with new microservice
architecture, based on the following technologies:

- Kotlin, as the primary programming language
- Kafka, as the main persistent data-store and as an event broker.
- Kubernetes for orchestration and enabling a Dev-ops workflow.
- Prometheus for monitoring

### VP Engineering - Aevy (2015-2017)

Aevy built a people search engine, aggregating information from multiple
sources on the web.

- Built central architecture for our React and Redux based webapp.
- Handling operations as we scaled out our elasticsearch cluster to several terrabytes and a dozen nodes.
- Designed worker infrastructure based on RabbitMQ
- Designed architecture for a large Cassandra & Postgresql-based system. The system handles data inflow for the complete activity of 1000s of email accounts and for 100s of webcrawlers.
- Designed infrastructure for checking the validity of email addresses at high speed using SMTP
